## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Student is NOT blocked
**Possible Causes:**
1. Maintenance mode not actually saved (check Firebase Console)
2. User has admin role (check users collection)
3. Real-time listener not working (check browser console)

**Fix:**
- Verify in Firebase: `systemSettings/config/maintenanceMode` = `true`
- Check user document: `users/{uid}/role` should NOT be 'admin'
- Check console for errors

---

### Problem: Admin IS blocked
**Possible Cause:**
- Admin user doesn't have `role: 'admin'` in Firestore

**Fix:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Open `users/{adminUid}` document
3. Add field: `role` = `admin`
4. Save
5. Refresh and try again

---

### Problem: Settings don't save
**Possible Causes:**
1. Security rules not deployed
2. Permission denied error

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify security rules in Firebase Console
- Ensure logged in as admin

---

### Problem: Real-time updates don't work
**Possible Cause:**
- Firestore listener not subscribed

**Fix:**
- Check browser console for subscription errors
- Verify Firebase connection
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
