# Tutorial Testing Guide

## How to Test Tutorials in Production

The tutorials are working correctly, but they only show for users who haven't completed them yet. Here's how to test:

### Method 1: Manual Trigger (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Dashboard Tutorial:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to `/dashboard`
   - Type: `window.startDashboardTutorial()`
   - Press Enter

2. **Reports Tutorial:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to `/student/reports`
   - Type: `window.startReportsTutorial()`
   - Press Enter

### Method 2: Reset Tutorial Status in Firebase

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Find your user document in `users` collection
4. Delete the `tutorialCompleted` field (or set `tutorialCompleted.dashboard: false`)
5. Refresh the dashboard page

### Method 3: Create New Account

1. Sign up with a new email
2. Login to dashboard
3. Tutorial should auto-start after 1.5 seconds

## Tutorial Behavior:

- **Auto-trigger**: Only for first-time users (no `tutorialCompleted` field in Firestore)
- **Completion**: Saves `tutorialCompleted.dashboard: true` or `tutorialCompleted.reports: true`
- **Skip**: User can skip anytime, still marks as completed
- **Re-trigger**: Use manual commands above, or reset in Firebase

## Why Tutorial Might Not Show:

1. âœ… User already completed it (field exists in Firestore)
2. âœ… User is still loading (wait for page to fully load)
3. âœ… Tutorial delay hasn't passed yet (1.5s for dashboard, 2s for reports)

## Console Logs to Look For:

When tutorial is working, you'll see:
- `ðŸ“š Starting dashboard tutorial for first-time user...` - Tutorial will start
- `âœ… User has already completed the tutorial` - Tutorial won't show (already done)

## Quick Test Commands:

```javascript
// Dashboard Tutorial
window.startDashboardTutorial()

// Reports Tutorial
window.startReportsTutorial()

// Check if tutorial function exists
console.log(typeof window.startDashboardTutorial) // should be "function"
```
